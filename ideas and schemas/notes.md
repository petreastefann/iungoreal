- todos:
	- docker & kubernetes
	- logs
	- tests
	- security
	- documentation
	- caching
	- messaging
	- notifications
	- monitoring
	- scalability

	- see how to implement the map microservice and how to integrate it with the app (add the map, shortest path algorithm, integrate feature for users to interact with the map)
	- add the chat microservice
	- continue with the app (models, db, etc.)
	- notifications
